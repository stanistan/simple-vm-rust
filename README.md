# simple vm rust

This is an implementation of a super simple stack based VM in Rust, as a learning
exercise for myself.

A lot of this is based on https://csl.name/post/vm, but while that is written in Python,
this is in not :) So there are obviously some more constraints in how this is run.

## Dependencies

- `Failure` for errors, this might be too much for something so simple and not really meant
  to be used anywhere, but I wanted to try it out.

## Running
